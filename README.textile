h2. Installation

*Get a copy of JRuby 1.4 for your platform*

For Ubuntu Lucid:
@sudo apt-get install jruby@

Downloads: "jruby.org":http://jruby.org/download

Make sure to add JRuby to your PATH after installation,
if it's not already there.

*Install backend dependencies*

The backend depends on the following ruby gems:
* jruby-openssl (0.6)
* json-jruby (1.2.4)
* neo4j (0.4.3)
* rack (1.1.0)
* sinatra (1.0)

For Ubuntu you would do:
@sudo jruby -S gem install jruby-openssl json-jruby neo4j rack sinatra@

*Start the backend*

In a console, navigate to the @backend/@ directory and run:
@jruby neo4j_app.rb@

Open a web-browser and go to "http://localhost:4567/":http://localhost:4567/

This will trigger a one-time indexing operation, you can follow the progress
of it in the console. It will take 1-5 minutes, when it's done your web browser
should display a set of JSON data.

h2. Running the example

*Start the local example*
      
Open the @webapp/index-LOCAL.html@ file in a web-browser. Click on one of the two "friends"
to get a movie suggestion.

*Start the facebook-connected example*

Move the contents of the @webapp@ -folder into a web server. Go to index.html with your browser.

You can use a local domain, it deosn't need to be exposed to the outside world at all.

Register an application on "facebook.com":http://facebook.com/, make sure to add the (local) domain
to the Connect settings and then add the application id you get to @webapp/js/MovieNight.js@
(scroll down near the end of the file, and you'll see where to put it).

*Hack the example*
     
The main example entry point is in @webapp/js/MovieNight.js@. There are comments in that file that
should send you on your merry way to explore what exactly is going on.
